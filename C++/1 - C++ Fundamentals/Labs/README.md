# C++ Fundamentals Labs

## Lab 1 - array_of_strings

### Description

Write a program that reads a number of strings from the user, stores them in dynamically allocated memory, and then prints them out before deallocating the memory. The program should first ask the user how many strings they want to enter, and then read the strings one at a time. The program should use a dynamically allocated array of pointers to store the strings.

### Description

Write a program that defines and manipulates a dynamic array structure. It includes functions to initialize the array, insert/delete elements at a specified position (shift the elements accordingly), and print the array. The program should also include a function to deallocate the memory used by the array.
